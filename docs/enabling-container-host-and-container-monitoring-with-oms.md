## What is Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS)?

Operations Management Suite (OMS) is a simplified IT Management Solution that provides Log Analytics, Automation, Backup and Site Recovery.  It also seamlessly integrates with your existing management solutions to provide a single pane of glass view. To learn more about OMS visit [microsoft.com/oms](http://microsoft.com/oms).

For our sample app, we will monitor the Azure VMs running as Docker hosts (called Nodes in Tutum) and the containers running on top of these Docker hosts (Nodes).

**1.** Sign up for Operations Management Suite trial [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/operations-management-suite/trial.aspx).

**2.** SSH to the ACS nodes and run the following commands to install the Operations Management Suite (OMS) Agent for Linux. For detailed information about OMS Agent for Linux, visit the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux).

    wget https://github.com/MSFTOSSMgmt/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/releases/download/1.0.0-47/omsagent-1.0.0-47.universal.x64.sh

    chmod +x ./omsagent-1.0.0-47.universal.x64.sh

    md5sum ./omsagent-1.0.0-47.universal.x64.sh

    ./omsagent-1.0.0-47.universal.x64.sh --install -w <YOUR OMS WORKSPACE ID> -s <YOUR OMS WORKSPACE PRIMARY KEY>

You can get the **Workspace ID** and **Primary Key** in **Settings > Connected Sources** in the OMS portal.
